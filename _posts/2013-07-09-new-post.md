Given a recorded speech sample the HPS algorithm results in a line that resembles the four Mandarin Chinese tones.
Still the result is not satisfying. Toney's users needs to be given clear intuitive feedback about their relative pitch over time. The goal is to have Toney output straight lines that looks like the grey ones in the picture below.
